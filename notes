1.use vector instead of CreatexxxArray alike array operations; use array in java, vector in cpp
2.BpInterface<xxx> and BnInterface<xxx> should be mapped to Stub/Proxy, not in CType.h
3.package to namespace
4.value passed by refs, not by pointer | There is no pointer in Java
5.RemoteException ???
6.asBinder,asInterface translation
7.oneway interface, not oneway method support
8.readFromParcel generate self from parcel  vs  createFromParcel create and return
   readFromParcel is used for INOUT/OUT where createFromParcel is used for return value
